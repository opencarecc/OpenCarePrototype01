# About InPe'
InPe' is a simple device that helps taking care of someone in case they fall down. The device is designed as a wearable that calls the caregiver and sends sms with coordinates, in order for them to come and help the person who fell down.  Inspired by true stories, InPe, serves different needs such as elderly parents living by themselves, or helping a caregiver in a community center. 


Story telling was an important factor in understanding and elaborating on problems. One of the project participants in the codesign sessions described a personal story where she lost her mother because she fell down while she was alone, and couldn’t ask for immediate help.  The mother indeed, had a solution of a necklace which can send an alarm to police/friends, but she didn’t wear, because the device wasn’t user friendly. Ideas were published on [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/en), and given certain criterias, it was selected.  


### InPe' Development
WeMake team is developing InPe' as an open source hardware wearable device that could be replicated by others who might need it.  As of summer 2016 a first prototyping phase has started, please keep an eye on [blog](http://inpe.opencare.cc/blog/) for further developments.


### The Process
Below you can find different links that will help you tracking the process InPe’ has originated from.

- MARCH - APRIL 2016_Together with Municipality of Milan, WeMake met different communities of milanese citizens, to talk about opencare:
  - Elderly people ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/03/10/opencare-e-balera-al-circolo-olmi-a-milano/) - [ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/meetings-with-milanese-community-march-12th-2016))

  - Active citizens ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/04/18/opencare-nella-social-street-di-via-san-gottardo/))
- MARCH - APRIL 2016_Simultaneously we also organized some workshops to introduce digital technologies applied to care topics:
  - Fa’ la cosa giusta ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/03/15/opencare-a-fa-la-cosa-giusta/) - [ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/prendersi-cura-con-strumenti-open-source-workshop))
  - Forum delle politiche sociali ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/04/05/opencare-al-forum-delle-politiche-sociali-workshop/) - [ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/localactivity-prendersi-cura-con-strumenti-open))
- MAY 2016_During this month WeMake and the Municipality of Milan organized three co-design sessions:
  -First session ([ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design))
  - Second session ([ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design-second-session))
  - Third session ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/05/30/annunciamo-il-primo-prototipo-di-opencare/) - [ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design-3))

- JUNE 2016 - ONGOING_After selecting In Pe’ for the prototyping phase we started developing it:
  - Preliminary development plan ([ENG](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/prototype01-preliminary-development-plan))
  - Hardware update ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/07/25/aggiornamenti-da-in-pe-primo-prototipo-opencare/))
  - Testing update ([ITA](http://wemake.cc/2016/10/06/novita-da-in-pe-il-braccialetto-che-allerta-in-caso-di-caduta/))

### What is opencare?
Opencare is an EU initiative that is meant to explore open hardware solutions that tackle the notion of care.  How do we care for others, how do we receive care, how do we care for ourselves, were questions that were researched in order to define a problem and its solution. **opencare** is a collaborative project between: University of Bordeaux, Scimpulse, Edgeryders, EHF, Municipality of Milan, and Wemake. 


WeMake is a makerspace in Milan, they are the partners in charge of the physical development and implementation of the prototype. All development and documentation are produced and maintained by WeMake team.



### Opencare process
The Opencare process has been open and collaborative since day one.  The strategy went as follow:
- Targeting potential users (elderly, special needs, etc)
- Organizing meetings in order to introduce the project to potential users
- Organizing co-design sessions with the users, in order to help them articulate problems and brainstorm some ideas for it
- Sharing problems and solutions with a wider audience, then selecting one after feedback and tech evaluation criteria
In line with the activities planned in Milan, we had a parallel track of online community communications on the Edgryders.eu platform
The team has published more detailed info about the process in the [playbook](http://playbook.opencare.cc/) here. A simple guide to replicate the process and learn more about its details.
