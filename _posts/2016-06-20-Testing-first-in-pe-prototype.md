**Testing first InPe’ Prototype**

In this post on [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/prototype01-preliminary-development-plan) you will find a first draft of the development plan for the first #opencare prototype.

Here is a brief description of the selected project:

The Question: Helping a care-taker monitor an elderly

The Problem: What if an elderly fell down while they were alone

The Solution: A wearable that can alarm/call others who can help the elderly
