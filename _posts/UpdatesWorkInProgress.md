**Work in progress InPe’**

![Work in progress - video]({{site.baseurl}}/http://wemake.cc/core/uploads/2017/03/zava-costa.jpg)

Check our latest multimedia documentation about  InPe’!

This video was shot during our interaction with Fabio Pinciroli and Francesco Zava of Cooperativa Sociale Alatha which accepted to take part to the testing phase:

**Explore In Pe’ prototype documentation on Github**

*(pic or screenshot)*

Do you want to make or understand a bit more about the technicalities of InPe’? Check out our repository on Github.

If you don’t know Github, here’s a little explanation to understand a bit more on how to collaborate on open source projects.

Github is a website and a service allowing people, especially software developers to share their projects and accept contributions by others.

To understand GitHub and other similar tools providing the same type of infrastructure, you must first meet Git. Git is an open-source version control system started by Linus Torvalds – the same person who created Linux - allowing developers to create pieces of code, to release new versions, keeping the process transparent.  Every developer can see  new changes, download them, and contribute without overwriting or erasing anything.

One of the main misunderstanding about GitHub is that it’s only for coders. However, GitHub itself is like a social network where you build a profile, upload projects, share many types of files to share and connect with other users by "following" their accounts. There are many [tutorials](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) around to understand how it works if you want to get started!

The InPe prototype is built on top of the RePhone hardware by Seeed Studio. More info on how to get started with the RePhone and the RePhone development environment can be found in the [wiki section](https://github.com/opencarecc/inpe/wiki) of the repo.

In the software folder of the repository are various Arduino .ino sketches, all of them can be ran by the RePhone hardware:

* in the software root folder are the updated main sketches of the InPe prototype (the "InPe-T*" versions have been implemented for the user testing campaign)

* in the software > utilities folder is a collection of sketches to test, calibrate and debug the hardware. They are useful to setup and customize an InPe, and for developers willing to contribute to the project to learn more about the library.

**Meet Domus’ students and their prototypes**

*(insert 1 image)*

The end of the [Rome Makerfaire](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/en/) marked the closure of the workshop lead by WeMake at Domus Academy, in order to help interaction design students start projects ideas and prototypes on Opencare topics.

The common theme was that the students managed to grasp the concept of opencare, and what does it mean to develop projects under the notion of care. On [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/ro/opencare-research/wemake-wrapped-up-opencare-workshop-at-domus-academy) you can find a sample of students suggestions which they already documented on the platform.

Check the [italian report](http://wemake.cc/2016/10/31/opencare-workshop-di-tangible-interactions-prototyping-con-domus-academy/) on WeMake blog

**What happened at MakerFaire?**

(video screenshot)

Check the video report of the opencare booth at Maker Faire Rome 2016! It was a lot of fun and a special thanks to all the people who visited us :)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1760elt3jR8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In Pe’ prototyped was showcased in the booth together with the Playbook and Domus Academy projects by students.

**Testing first InPe’ Prototype**

In this post on [Edgeryders](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/prototype01-preliminary-development-plan) you will find a first draft of the development plan for the first #opencare prototype.

Here is a brief description of the selected project:

The Question: Helping a care-taker monitor an elderly

The Problem: What if an elderly fell down while they were alone

The Solution: A wearable that can alarm/call others who can help the elderly

Read it in italian on  [WeMake](http://wemake.cc/2016/07/25/aggiornamenti-da-in-pe-primo-prototipo-opencare/) blog.

**Co-design documentation and Playbook**

During the past months the Municipality of Milan and WeMake met groups of citizens and collaborative communities to start engaging them in Opencare.

Then we organized three co-design sessions, which involved participants from different backgrounds and with different needs.  Check the reports written by Municipality of Milan  for each sessions: [first](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design) - [second](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design-second-session) - [third](https://edgeryders.eu/en/opencare-research/report-local-activity-co-design-3)  and [explore the gallery on Flickr.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wemake_cc/albums/72157667820435861)  Foto Andrea Balossi?

Wanna know more about methodology? opencare Playbook aka "Co-designing care services: a practical guide" is a little contribute for all innovators who wants to start to make a change in their community. The Playbook describes a general path for starting collaborative processes that you can adapt as needed. The playbook is related to engagement processes (local and online), co-design sessions, prototyping and sharing documentation as parts of the entire process.
